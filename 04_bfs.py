'''
The steps of the algorithm work as follow:

- Start by putting any one of the graphâ€™s vertices at the back of the queue.
- Now take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
- Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add those which are not within the visited list to the rear of the queue.
- Keep continuing steps two and three till the queue is empty.
NOTE: for this implementation to work, 
you have to mark leaf node in a self loop while defining the graph
else it will give KeyError
